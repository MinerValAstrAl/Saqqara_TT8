                       Setting up bait bit by bit alongside his father, his mother used the rug whip
                           Streets ebb and later overflow at noon, rain together with the red moon
                 Â´Time for lunch` she announced, and they jog back in silence so not to scare the prey away
                                              Trials and rituals mirrored in acts
                                                A moth staring from the closet gap
                                                  Rats and bats knew it was time
                             Three deers wandered by, civilized without a slight plan, journeying
         Rallying under taoist bibles quenching cataclysmic events, until a delightfully deceiving smell hit them
                                              A seed had been planted in their mind
                                                 More eyes than one could see
                                                 Doing overlooks beyond vision
                                                 Around kabbalisticly blured lanterns


                  Underestimating the maze layed out before them
              The long awaited fall of the pack into completed oblivion
                    All where headlessly heading for the trap
   Then a lone howl yield was heard, induced fear and diverted their grave path
                      Light at the end of the forest tunnel
            A convex reflection making the threat appear so much, grander
                       So we where blind to the shovel holes
                           Scrambeling for a mere shadow
               Things necessarily go rampant while approaching the alter
                       Uncontrollable instincts is like a river
                        Time will show where the masses flow


                   Young Tommy was growing up in a vicious world with hopeless minds, standing in front
                                                    Get your guards, down
                                          What is thirst, hungering for adventure
Got to catch it, got to catch it, got to catch it, got to catch it, got to catch it, got to catch it, got to catch it
                                    The eroded trembling grand master frantically yelling
Water is coming, water is coming, water is coming, water is coming.
Water is coming, water is coming, water is coming, water is coming
